👋 Hey! Orion, Visionary Artist, here!
<br>
👀 I’m interested in playing games and developing skills in audio engineering and drums. I translate texts between Brazilian Portuguese and English to spread Brazlian Culture and make English content more available to Brazilian Portuguese speakers as a hobby, <a href="https://ponte-arco-iris.tumblr.com/">check it out</a>.<br>
<br>
🌱 I’m currently working with AI Image Creation with tools like Bing's Image Creator and Microsoft Designer, Midjourney, and Leonardo (with a litte ChatGPT on the side).<br>
💞️ I’m happy to collaborate with any Open Source project I can help develop feel free to use the repositories.<br>
