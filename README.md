👋 Hi, I’m Márcio Vianna Júnior, aka Shiva Andromeda Orion!
<br>
👀 I’m interested in playing games and the guitar, and translating texts between Brazilian Portuguese and English to spread Brazlian Culture and make English content more available to Brazilian Portuguese speakers with a personal touch.<br>
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning about AI Development and Visionary Art.<br>
💞️ I’m happy to collaborate with any Open Source project I can help develop.<br>
👨🏻‍💻 Currently studying AI tools such as leonardo.ai, Midjourney, Perplexity, Deep AI, and ChatGPT.<br>
<br>
